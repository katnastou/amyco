Disease Name: Periodic fever, familial, autosomal dominant

Description: An inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever; onset is typically in early childhood. Fevers usually persist for about three weeks, though they can be longer or shorter, and may not occur again for several weeks or several years. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain; myalgia; arthralgia; skin rash and systemic inflammation; amyloidosis may also occur in some cases. There is often no trigger, but episodes are sometimes preceded by infections, injury, or stress. Germline mutations in the TNFRSFIA gene have been identified.

Disease Type: Clinical conditions associated with amyloidosis

ICD-10 Classification: Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue
