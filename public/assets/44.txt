Disease Name: Corneal dystrophy Avellino type

Description: A hereditary autosomal dominant corneal dystrophy that is characterized by the development of small granules on the stromal layer of the cornea which later develop into lesions with a lattice-like appearance. The lesions increase in size with age and may lead to decreased visual acuity. Mutations in the TGFBI  gene have been identified.

Disease Type: Amyloidosis
