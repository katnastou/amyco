Disease Name: Cystic Fibrosis

Description: An autosomal recessive genetic disease of the exocrine glands. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator expressed in several organs including the lung, the pancreas, the biliary system, and the sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by epithelial secretory dysfunction associated with ductal obstruction resulting in airway obstruction; chronic respiratory infections; pancreatic insufficiency; maldigestion; salt depletion; and heat prostration.

Disease Type: Clinical conditions associated with amyloidosis

ICD-10 Classification: Endocrine, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases

Tissue: Kidney, Liver, Spleen, Heart, Gastrointestinal Tract, Lung
