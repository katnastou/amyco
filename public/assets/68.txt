Disease Name: Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency

Description: Autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene. Because of the mutations cholesterol biosynthesis is disrupted and mevalonic acid accumulates. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including dysmorphic facies, psychomotor retardation, cataract, hepatosplenomegaly, cerebellar ataxia, elevated immunoglobulin D, and recurrent febrile crises with fever; lymphadenopathy; arthralgia; edema; and rash.
