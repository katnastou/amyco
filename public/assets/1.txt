Disease Name: Alzheimer Disease

Description: A degenerative disease of the brain characterized by the insidious onset of dementia. Impairment of memory, judgment, attention span, and problem solving skills are followed by severe apraxias and a global loss of cognitive abilities. The condition primarily occurs after age 60, and is marked pathologically by severe cortical atrophy and the triad of senile plaques; neurofibrillary tangles; and neuropil threads.

Disease Type: Amyloidosis

ICD-10 Classification: Diseases of the Nervous System

Tissue: Central Nervous System (CNS)
