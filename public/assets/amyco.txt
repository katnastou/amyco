Disease Name: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2

Description: A subclass of diabetes mellitus that is not insulin-responsive or dependent (NIDDM). It is characterized initially by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia; and eventually by glucose intolerance; hyperglycemia; and overt diabetes. Type II diabetes mellitus is no longer considered a disease exclusively found in adults. Patients seldom develop ketosis but often exhibit obesity.

Disease Name: Huntington Disease

Description: A familial disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and characterized by the onset of progressive chorea and dementia in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Common initial manifestations include paranoia; poor impulse control; depression; hallucinations; and delusions. Eventually intellectual impairment; loss of fine motor control; athetosis; and diffuse chorea involving axial and limb musculature develops, leading to a vegetative state within 10-15 years of disease onset. The juvenile variant has a more fulminant course including seizures; ataxia; dementia; and chorea.

Disease Name: Parkinson Disease

Description: A progressive, degenerative neurologic disease characterized by a tremor that is maximal at rest, retropulsion (i.e. a tendency to fall backwards), rigidity, stooped posture, slowness of voluntary movements, and a masklike facial expression. Pathologic features include loss of melanin containing neurons in the substantia nigra and other pigmented nuclei of the brainstem. Lewy bodies are present in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus but may also be found in a related condition (lewy body disease, diffuse) characterized by dementia in combination with varying degrees of parkinsonism.

Disease Name: Kuru

Description: A prion disease found exclusively among the Fore linguistic group natives of the highlands of New Guinea. The illness is primarily restricted to adult females and children of both sexes. It is marked by the subacute onset of tremor and ataxia followed by motor weakness and incontinence. Death occurs within 3-6 months of disease onset. The condition is associated with ritual cannibalism, and has become rare since this practice has been discontinued. Pathologic features include a noninflammatory loss of neurons that is most prominent in the cerebellum, glial proliferation, and amyloid plaques.

Disease Name: Lewy Body Disease

Description: A neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, mild parkinsonism, and fluctuations in attention and alertness. The neuropsychiatric manifestations tend to precede the onset of bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and other extrapyramidal signs. Delusions and visual hallucinations are relatively frequent in this condition. Histologic examination reveals lewy bodies in the cerebral cortex and brain stem. Senile plaques and other pathologic features characteristic of Alzheimer disease may also be present.

Disease Name: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2a

Description: A form of multiple endocrine neoplasia characterized by the presence of medullary carcinoma (carcinoma, medullary) of the thyroid gland, and usually with the co-occurrence of pheochromocytoma, producing calcitonin and adrenaline, respectively. Less frequently, it can occur with hyperplasia or adenoma of the parathyroid glands. This disease is due to gain-of-function mutations of the MEN2 gene on chromosome 10(Locus: 10q11.2), also known as the ret proto-oncogene that encodes a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. It is an autosomal dominant inherited disease.

Disease Name: Periodic fever, familial, autosomal dominant

Description: An inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever; onset is typically in early childhood. Fevers usually persist for about three weeks, though they can be longer or shorter, and may not occur again for several weeks or several years. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain; myalgia; arthralgia; skin rash and systemic inflammation; amyloidosis may also occur in some cases. There is often no trigger, but episodes are sometimes preceded by infections, injury, or stress. Germline mutations in the TNFRSFIA gene have been identified.

Description: A rare form of dementia that is sometimes familial. Clinical features include aphasia; apraxia; confusion; anomia; memory loss; and personality deterioration. This pattern is consistent with the pathologic findings of circumscribed atrophy of the poles of the frontal lobe and temporal lobe. Neuronal loss is maximal in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. Some ballooned cortical neurons contain argentophylic (Pick) bodies.

Disease Type: Amyloidosis

ICD-10 Classification: Diseases of the Nervous System

Tissue: Central Nervous System (CNS)
