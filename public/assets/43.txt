Disease Name: Corneal dystrophy, gelatinous drop-like

Description: A hereditary autosomal recessive corneal dystrophy characterized by severe corneal amyloidosis leading to blindness. Clinical manifestations, which appear in the first decade of life, include blurred vision, photophobia, and foreign-body sensation. By the third decade, raised, yellowish-gray, gelatinous masses severely impair visual acuity, and corneal transplantation is required for most patients. Mutations in the TACSTD2 gene have been identified.

Disease Type: Amyloidosis
