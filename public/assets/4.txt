Disease Name: Parkinson Disease

Description: A progressive, degenerative neurologic disease characterized by a tremor that is maximal at rest, retropulsion (i.e. a tendency to fall backwards), rigidity, stooped posture, slowness of voluntary movements, and a masklike facial expression. Pathologic features include loss of melanin containing neurons in the substantia nigra and other pigmented nuclei of the brainstem. Lewy bodies are present in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus but may also be found in a related condition (lewy body disease, diffuse) characterized by dementia in combination with varying degrees of parkinsonism.

Disease Type: Amyloidosis

ICD-10 Classification: Diseases of the Nervous System

Tissue: Central Nervous System (CNS)
