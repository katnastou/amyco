Disease Name: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2a

Description: A form of multiple endocrine neoplasia characterized by the presence of medullary carcinoma (carcinoma, medullary) of the thyroid gland, and usually with the co-occurrence of pheochromocytoma, producing calcitonin and adrenaline, respectively. Less frequently, it can occur with hyperplasia or adenoma of the parathyroid glands. This disease is due to gain-of-function mutations of the MEN2 gene on chromosome 10(Locus: 10q11.2), also known as the ret proto-oncogene that encodes a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. It is an autosomal dominant inherited disease.

Disease Type: Clinical conditions associated with amyloidosis

ICD-10 Classification: Endocrine, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases
