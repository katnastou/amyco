1	Alzheimer Disease	A degenerative disease of the brain characterized by the insidious onset of dementia. Impairment of memory, judgment, attention span, and problem solving skills are followed by severe apraxias and a global loss of cognitive abilities.

2	Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2	A subclass of diabetes mellitus that is not insulin-responsive or dependent (NIDDM). It is characterized initially by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia; and eventually by glucose intolerance; hyperglycemia; and overt diabetes. Type II diabetes mellitus is no longer considered a disease exclusively found in adults. Patients seldom develop ketosis but often exhibit obesity.

3	Huntington Disease	A familial disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and characterized by the onset of progressive chorea and dementia in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Common initial manifestations include paranoia; poor impulse control; depression; hallucinations; and delusions. Eventually intellectual impairment; loss of fine motor control; athetosis; and diffuse chorea involving axial and limb musculature develops, leading to a vegetative state within 10-15 years of disease onset. The juvenile variant has a more fulminant course including seizures; ataxia; dementia; and chorea.	Amyloidosis	Diseases of the Nervous System	Central Nervous System (CNS)

Pathologic features include loss of melanin containing neurons in the substantia nigra and other pigmented nuclei of the brainstem. Lewy bodies are present in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus but may also be found in a related condition (lewy body disease, diffuse) characterized by dementia in combination with varying degrees of parkinsonism.
